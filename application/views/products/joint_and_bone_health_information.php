        	<h2>Bone &amp; Joint Health</h2>
            
            <h4>Osteoporosis</h4>
            <p>Osteoporosis is a silent, debilitating disease that progresses painlessly and without symptoms until bones become so frail that a sudden strain, sprain or fall causes a bone fracture. Ninety-nine percent of the calcium we consume is stored in bones; the 1% that stays in our blood must remain at a constant level in order to support a wide variety of essential bodily functions. If blood calcium levels drop too low, calcium is leached from the bones to make up the deficit. Hence osteoporosis develops when blood calcium levels drop leaving bones weak and easily broken. Osteoporosis affects one in two women and one in eight men over the age of 50. Postmenopausal women are especially at risk since women in general have less bone tissue and lose bone more rapidly than men because of hormonal changes during menopause.<img src="<?php echo base_url()."images/prod_images/bone.jpg" ; ?>" width="378" height="375"  align="right"/></p>

            <h4>Osteoporosis Treatment Requires Phosphorus</h4>
            <p>New research studies published in the Journal of American College of Nutrition demonstrate that osteoporosis patients should receive their calcium in the form of calcium phosphate. The studies also show that as calcium intake increases without a corresponding increase in phosphorus, total phosphorus absorption falls and the risk for phosphorus deficiency rises. Phosphorus deficiency may render calcium supplementation less effective and can lead to increased bone loss.1 Thus, calcium phosphate is strongly recommended for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.</p>
            
            <p>Trace Minerals for Bone Health</p>
            
            <p>Magnesium activates the enzyme that triggers formation of calcium crystals in bone, and converts vitamin D to its active form. Studies have correlated magnesium intake with bone mineral density - and magnesium deficiency with osteoporosis. Zinc enhances the activity of vitamin D, which is crucial for calcium absorption. Studies show that elderly osteoporosis patients are often low in zinc, and that supplementation can improve bone mineral density.</p>
            
            <p>Vitamins for enhanced Calcium Absorption</p>
            
            <p>When Vitamin D is added to the formula, absorption of the calcium is increased even further. Vitamin D works with the parathyroid hormone to regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. Vitamin D deficiency is common among the elderly living in the northern states, therefore, it is recommended that the elderly take a multivitamin daily, eat vitamin D rich foods, and have regular sun exposure (several times a week with sunscreen) in the spring, summer and fall. Vitamin C, on the other hand, is a co-factor in collagen production.</p>
            
            <h4>The Innovite Health Difference</h4>
            <p>Inno-Cal-Mag Complex is a SUPERIOR calcium supplement because it provides:</p>
            <p>1. Liquid in Softgel format</p>
            <p>Recognizing the difficulty that many individuals have in digesting tablets, Inno-Cal-Mag offers liquid calcium magnesium in a softgel form. Liquid suspensions are significantly easier to digest and absorb than tablets.</p>
            <p>2. Essential co-factors in correctly balanced ratios</p>
            <p>Nutrients such as vitamin D3, and C greatly improve the absorption of calcium. Another unique feature is the base of Omega 3 essential fatty acids. Not only do EFA's increase the absorbability of calcium magnesium, but also aid in keeping the liquid suspension from dehydration.</p>
            <p>3. Calcium Phosphate - A highly bioavailable form of calcium</p>
            <p>With research confirming the need for phosphate in osteoporosis prevention, dibasic calcium phosphate is the choice of calcium for bone health. Bioavailability studies confirm that dibasic calcium phosphate is a highly absorbable form of calcium that is incorporated into bone matrix. </p>
