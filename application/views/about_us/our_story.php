          		<h2>Our Story</h2>
          		<p>For over 30 years, Innovite Health has been inspiring wellness and developing ways to nourish and repair our bodies. We believe that when the body’s core systems work in synergy, optimal health can be achieved.<br>
                  <br>
                  That synergistic balance relies on a strong nutritional foundation. With today’s lifestyle, many factors contribute to depleting the body’s reserves of these critical nutrients. Our goal at Innovite Health is to nourish and heal the body from the inside out. By restoring nutrients and repairing damage, you can reclaim your health.<br>
                  <br>
                  Our nutritional foundation is built from the latest research and clinical evidence, and is safe, natural and effective. Our range of formulas with clinically proven ingredients allows you to choose the right product for your body’s needs, at every stage of life.<br>
                  <br>
                  When it comes to health, we strive for excellence and are honoured to be recognized in our industry and to have our formulas be used in some of Canada’s leading hospitals. Our desire to help make a difference keeps us motivated and involved with various charities and organizations that inspire and lead change towards healthier living.<br>
                At Innovite Health, we think it’s what’s inside that counts and that is true for our products, our people and you.</p>
