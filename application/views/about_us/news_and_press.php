                <p>PRESS RELEASE <br>
                  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  </p>
                <h4>Innovite Health  re-launches  Yeast Buster® candida detox kit </h4>
                <p><em>Now with Activated Charcoal for easier digestion</em></p>
                <p>January 22, 2014 – Concord, ON – Innovite Health, a leading manufacturer and distributor of research-based nutritional supplements, is proud to introduce the new and improved Yeast Buster® candida detox kit. The formula now offers Activated Charcoal for easier digestion during the detox process.</p>
                <p>Proven safe and effective for over 25 years, <strong>Yeast Buster® candida detox </strong>can help<strong>:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>RESTORE </strong> good bacteria and reduce yeast overgrowth </li>
                  <li><strong>REPAIR </strong>the intestinal tract and colon by eliminating the damaging effects of candida yeast<strong></strong></li>
                  <li><strong>RECLAIM </strong>and optimize intestinal health.<strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Yeast Buster® is a complete candida detox system that includes:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Activated Charcoal: </strong>Used in conventional medicine to trap toxins and prevent further absorption. <strong></strong></li>
                  <li><strong>DDS Acidophilus Probiotics: </strong>Contains a proprietary, clinically-proven, human-sourced probiotic strain to rebalance the intestinal tract. <strong></strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Psyllium: </strong>soluble fiber<strong> </strong>that works synergistically with other Yeast Buster® components through toxin elimination.  <strong></strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Caproil: </strong>Used in traditional medicine to eliminate candida.<strong></strong></li>
              </ul>
                <p>&ldquo;With Activated Charcoal, the Yeast Buster® anti-candida protocol not only continues to help the body eliminate toxins, but now helps minimize the risk of constipation without the use of additional laxatives.&rdquo; states Lee Know, N.D., and Research and Development Director at Innovite Health.  This also helps the many detox users who forget to increase their overall water intake.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The Yeast Buster® kit also includes a patented probiotic backed by clinical and traditional evidence.&rdquo; further explains Know.  &ldquo;This strain demonstrates resistance to acid and bile to ensure maximum probiotic delivery to the G.I. tract. Since the strain is grown on a dairy-free, gluten-free and soy-free medium, it is suitable for individuals with sensitive or restrictive diets making it a perfect complementary detox product to re-establish your intestinal foundation.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Soluble fibers, including those from psyllium seed and husk, have been clinically shown to augment the cholesterol-lowering effects of low-fat diets. Yeast Buster Psyllium includes a 50/50 blend of seeds and husk – a big added value compared to other competitive products (which are typically just husk).  Caproil is a medium chain fatty acid product, and one of the leading natural antifungals, which kills candida yeast overgrowth  during this detox process. <strong></strong></p>
