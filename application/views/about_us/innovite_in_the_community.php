        	  <h2>Igniting compassion and action</h2>
        	  <p>We are a national company with deep roots in the fabric of the local communities.  How and why we do things matter as much as what we do. Our aim is to connect the places where we work and live and to conduct ourselves with  the highest levels of integrity and generosity.  We believe it is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to build a healthier home and better community.  We care about the same things you do and we are putting our commitments into practice.    From providing Canadians with a full spectrum of cardiovascular support products, to providing a key component  in a protocol cocktail for patients suffering from mitochondrial disease, our work defines who we are and why we do what we do.    </p>
              <p>See some of our community partnerships.  Learn how these  groups are making a difference and share these special stories.  More importantly, take this inspiration and bring change to your life and the lives of others.  Help and participate.  </p>
